        <h1>California Valley Coyote</h1>
      </div>
      <p class="p1">(Canis latrans ssp. ochropus)</p>
      <p class="p2">
        The California Valley Coyote is a subspecies of the North American
        Coyote (canis latrans.)
      </p>
      <p class="p3">
        The main difference between the two is that Californiaâ€™s Coyote is
        smaller, darker, brightly colored, and has larger ears. Coyote has
        roughly 19 subspecies around the continent. They are known widely
        throughout Native communities in each tribe. In the Ohlone Nation,
        Coyote is portrayed in two different ways, a trickster (very common in
        other Native Tribes), or more often being a hero or protagonist. One of
        Ohlone's creation stories states that Coyote and his wife had children
        that became the Ohlone people. Coyote raised them and taught them the
        arts of civilization.

      <p class="p4">
        Luckily they are at the least concern for extinction or endangerment.
        Their population is higher now than ever because of the disappearance of
        the closely related Gray Wolf. Just like California grizzly bears,
        European colonizers killed off wolves because they were a threat to the
        settlers and their livestock. Usually portrayed as a carnivore, Coyote
        is actually an omnivore and can adapt depending on the environment in
        which they are. Once America was colonized, Ango-American culture
        depicted Coyote as negative and thought of them as dangerous, cowardly,
        and untrustworthy. When researching Coyote online, most of the links,
        articles, and photos are attached to a negative story about Coyote
        attacking people, perpetuating this hostile public image they are
        associated with.
