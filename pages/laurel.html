<p class="p1">(Umbellularia californica)</p>
<p class="p2"> A plant of the Lauraceae family, the California Bay is an evergreen tree that has reddish brown bark and yellow umbel shaped flowers.</p>
<p class="p3"> In the fall, they produce a small yellow fruit and flowers from November to May. They are usually found in canyons, valleys, and open hills throughout what is now California and Oregon. The Ohlone nation used California Bays for many reasons. The fruit was commonly eaten, and the kernels were roasted or grinded into flour. Burning the leaves would rid others of fleas, damp leaves on the head would help headaches, and they would use it to aid with poison oak breakouts.</p>
