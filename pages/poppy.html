      <p class="p2">
        The California Poppy is a flowering plant native to the Western North
        America and Baja California. Their colors are usually orange, but red,
        yellow, and pink colors are possible as well.
      </p>
      <p class="p3">
        In 1903, California named them the ‘State Flower.’ A common Californian
        myth linked with the title is that you cannot pick them because they are
        the state flower. However, there is actually no law protecting them
        directly. You can pick them anywhere except on state property (like
        schools, courts, and government buildings.)
      </p>
      <p class="p4">
        During their bloom season, many people gather in Antelope Valley, Bear
        Valley, and Point Buchon to see acres of stunning orange flowers. In
        Ohlone culture, the poppy was placed under the bed to aid children with
        insomnia. They also boiled the plant to rid others of head lice. In Pomo
        culture, they used mashed poppy seed pods to stop nursing.
