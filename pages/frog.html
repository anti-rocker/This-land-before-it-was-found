  <h1>California Red-Legged Frog</h1></div>
  <p class="p1">(Rana draytonii)</p>
  <p class="p2"> The red-legged frog is the largest native frog in the western side of what we call the United States.
    </p>
  <p class="p3"> Their size ranges from 1.75 to 5.25 inches and their colors can be red, orange, brown, or olive. The red-legged frog is protected by California Law ever since they were given the title “threatened” in 2006.
     It is estimated that about 70% of their natural environment has been taken away due to the
    introduction of the American Bullfrog, and the destruction of their natural habitats.
    They were also an important food source for the endangered San Francisco Garter snake, which was also moved out of the bay area after city developments.
     The frogs and their coastal and southern California regions are now being cared for by the <a href="https://www.fws.gov/">US Fish and Wildlife service.</a>
     In 2015, they were designated the “state amphibian” for California.
