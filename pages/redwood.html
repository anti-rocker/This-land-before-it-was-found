        The California Coastal Redwood is a broadleaf evergreen long living tree that is instantly recognizable.
      </p>
      <p class="p3">
        It is only found along the coast of California (and some south Oregon) and used to occur naturally in about two million acres in those areas. They are among the oldest in the world, and the tallest as well. Discovered in 2006, the tallest tree, Hyperion, comes in at 379.7 feet. Typically they live for 500 to 700 years, however there has been one found that was estimated at 2,000 years old. Their leaves, roots, bark, and wood leave them impervious to insects, fungal infections, and rot, which could contribute to old age. They are however named threatened since lodging became common in the mid 1800s. The Ohlone lived among the redwoods near the Palos Colorados trail for centuries. They lived along creeks in these forests, including Sausal Creek, and also performed controlled burns to prevent larger destruction and fires. They lived among what we call the old growth trees, and in modern times, the second growth trees remain.

        During their bloom season, many people gather in Antelope Valley, Bear
        Valley, and Point Buchon to see acres of stunning orange flowers. In
        Ohlone culture, the poppy was placed under the bed to aid children with
        insomnia. They also boiled the plant to rid others of head lice. In Pomo
        culture, they used mashed poppy seed pods to stop nursing.
