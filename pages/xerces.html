<p class="p2"> The Xerces Blue Butterfly was a beautifully striking butterfly who made their home in the coastal sandy dunes that exhibit today’s Sunset/Richmond Districts in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="p3">They belong to the LYCAENIDAE family and fed on the Lotus and Lupinus genuses of plants. They were small, colorful, and under constant examination once Europeans started to occupy California. Sadly, they went extinct in 1941. It was the first North American butterfly to become extinct as the result of human action.
  In 1971, a non-profit named themselves the <a href="https://www.xerces.org/">‘Xerces Society’</a> and now have devoted their time to save endangered or threatened invertebrates and their environments.
