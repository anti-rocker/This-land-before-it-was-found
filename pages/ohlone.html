        The Ohlone tribe is a Native Nation that originally inhabited the bay area in present day California. Before colonization, they didn’t view themselves as one big tribe, but several different ones.
      </p>
      <p class="p3">
        With estimated over 7,000 people, these groups include Ramaytush (San Francisco area), Cochenyo (east bay area), Karkin (north bay area), Tamien (Santa Clara valley), Awaswas (North Monterey bay), Rumsien (south Monterey bay), Mutsun (east of Monterey bay), and Chalon (south of Mutsun and Rumsien.) They ate mostly nuts, berries, acorns, wild game, fish, rabbits, deer. They consider it sacred to hunt and train themselves not only physically but spiritually and have a strict code of conduct to follow when hunting.They told stories of animals that were important to the land. These were often about coyote, hummingbird, and eagle. They bound tule, a grass native to the area, together to build their houses and boats.

        Once the Spanish came to California, the Ohlone was forced to work and stay in their missions. Notable missions included Dolores, San Jose, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz to name a few. During this time, they were hit hard with introduced diseases and many were lost. More recently, the Ohlone have struggled to be federally recognized as a tribe by the United States government. They were once recognized in the past but now there are seven different modern Ohlone tribes that are trying to become federally recognized. As of now, none of them are.
