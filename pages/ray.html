      <p class="p2">
        Bat Rays are a type of eagle ray that exists solely on our coast. Their
        range is from southern Oregon to the gulf of California.
      </p>
      <p class="p3">
        Their habitat mostly consists of sandy and muddy sea floors. Although
        they aren’t dangerous Bat Rays, like other stingrays, have a venomous
        tail that can be used as an attack if they are frightened. They aren’t
        considered endangered or threatened and are a common addition to
        California aquariums. They can have a height (wing to wing) of 5.9 feet
        and can weigh up to 200 pounds. They were hunted in the bay regularly by
        the Ohlone for food. Bat Rays however mostly feed on crustaceans and
        molluscs. More recently people fish for them for commercial use in
        Mexico, and for sport along the California coast.

        During their bloom season, many people gather in Antelope Valley, Bear
        Valley, and Point Buchon to see acres of stunning orange flowers. In
        Ohlone culture, the poppy was placed under the bed to aid children with
        insomnia. They also boiled the plant to rid others of head lice. In Pomo
        culture, they used mashed poppy seed pods to stop nursing.
