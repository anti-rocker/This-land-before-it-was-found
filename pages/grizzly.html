        The California Grizzly bear is one that can be recognized easily by
        anyone local as our state symbol. What many people don’t know however is
        that they have been extinct since 1924.

      <p class="p3">
        Over 10,000 roamed this land before it was “found.” They were located
        everywhere in California and seen feeding on everything from beached
        whales to berries, deer, and fish. It is speculated by a 1769 trade from
        Spanish explorers that since the Ohlone accepted grizzly meat, it
        implies they have eaten it before. Some Ohlone were also seen wearing
        bear skin in the 1700s and bear bones were found in their shellmounds.
        It is known that grizzlies would attack the Ohlone since they hunted the
        same prey and enjoyed the same nuts and berries.

        European colonizers hunted them to protect their livestock, and of
        course for sport, even admiring several individuals who killed hundreds.
        After the gold rush in the mid 1800s, it was commonplace to see
        grizzlies killed, or kept in captivity. These same individuals also
        pitted the bears against bulls in fights. They ended up on the flag from
        the short lived California Republic, who aided the US in the
        Mexican-American war. Even after all of this background, the bear was
        named our state animal in 1953. The most famous grizzly bear is the one
        our flag is based on, Monarch. Monarch was kept in captivity for over 22
        years (most of which was in San Francisco.) He was taxidermied and used
        as a model for the state flag. The photos of him below are some of the
        only pictures of the California Grizzly bear to exist.
