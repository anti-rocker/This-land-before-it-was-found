        The California Quail is a small ground dwelling bird that is often
        recognized from the plume atop their head.
      </p>
      <p class="p3">
        The plume in fact was a prized addition to Pomo basket weavers.
        Established as the California ‘state bird’ in 1932, the valley quail
        surprisingly has seven native subspecies that span from Oregon through
        Nevada, to Baja California. Traveling with others in what we call
        coveys, California quails spend their time mostly on the ground foraging
        for foods. Usually they can be seen running quickly, but they can take
        off flying quickly to gain necessary coverage or shelter. They have been
        known to partake in daily ‘dust baths’ where they sink their bellies in
        the dirt and flap around causing dust to fly around them. They are very
        social and have now been introduced to several different locations
        around the globe. For the Ohlone, it was common to eat the eggs from a
        quail. You can still find these made traditionally at
        <a href="https://www.makamham.com/">Cafe Ohlone</a>.

      <!-- <p class="p4">
        During their bloom season, many people gather in Antelope Valley, Bear
        Valley, and Point Buchon to see acres of stunning orange flowers. In
        Ohlone culture, the poppy was placed under the bed to aid children with
        insomnia. They also boiled the plant to rid others of head lice. In Pomo
        culture, they used mashed poppy seed pods to stop nursing.
